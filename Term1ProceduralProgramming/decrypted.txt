No one is unaware of the name of that famous nnglish shipowner, Cunard.
qn 1840 this shrewd industrialist founded a postal service between Liverpool and Halifax, featuring three wooden ships with 400thorsepower paddle wheels and a burden of 1,1m2 metric tons.
night years later, the company's assets were increased by four m50thorsepower ships at 1,820 metric tons, and in two more years, by two other vessels of still greater power and tonnage.
qn 185d the Cunard Co., whose mailtcarrying charter had just been renewed, successively added to its assets the prabia, the Persia, the China, the Scotia, the Java, and the Russia, all ships of top speed and, after the hreat nastern, the biggest ever to plow the seas.
So in 18m7 this company owned twelve ships, eight with paddle wheels and four with propellers.
qf q give these highly condensed details, it is so everyone can fully understand the importance of this maritime transportation company, known the world over for its shrewd management.
No transoceanic navigational undertaking has been conducted with more ability, no business dealings have been crowned with greater success.
qn twentytsix years Cunard ships have made 2,000 ptlantic crossings without so much as a voyage canceled, a delay recorded, a man, a craft, or even a letter lost.
pccordingly, despite strong competition from xrance, passengers still choose the Cunard line in preference to all others, as can be seen in a recent survey of official documents.
hiven this, no one will be astonished at the uproar provoked by this accident involving one of its finest steamers.
